# Flight Booker Task

Thanks for the opportunity of working on this assignment. Here you'll find some information on the project as well as ideas on how to improve it if more time was available.

### The Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project also includes:

- 🔐 **TypeScript** — For Type checking
- 💅 **Material UI** — Components and Styles
- 💖 **ESlint** — For linting

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## What I would have done if given more time
